# CSS Flexbox Cheatsheet ([link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dzhavat.css-flexbox-cheatsheet))

VS Code extension that lets you open a flexbox cheatsheet directly in the editor.

## Features

The cheatsheet can be opened in two ways:

* Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Win, Linux) / `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) and search for the `Open CSS Flexbox Cheatsheet` command.
* Hover any `display: flex` declaration and click the `Open CSS Flexbox Cheatsheet` link in the popup.

Besides the `Open CSS Flexbox Cheatsheet` link in the hover popup, there’s also an image shown for each flexbox property. This aims to make it easier to understand how each property works without opening the cheatsheet.

Most properties now also have interactive demos which can help you see how each value works.

Works with the following file types:

* CSS
* Less
* Sass
* Scss

The colors of the cheatsheet automatically adapt to the selected theme. The font is based on the user’s preferred font.
